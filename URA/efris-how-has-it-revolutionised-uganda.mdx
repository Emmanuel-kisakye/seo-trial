## Introduction

In recent years, Uganda has seen transformative changes in its tax compliance system, primarily driven by the Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing System (EFRIS). This innovative electronic tax system is designed to streamline revenue collection, improve transparency, and offer enhanced taxpayer services. The Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) has been at the forefront of this initiative, ensuring that both taxpayers and the government benefit from a more efficient taxation process.

## What is EFRIS?

EFRIS stands for the Electronic Fiscal Receipting and Invoicing System. It is an electronic tax system introduced by the Uganda Revenue Authority to enhance tax compliance across the country. The system automates the process of issuing fiscal documents, such as receipts and invoices, and ensures real-time tracking of business transactions. This not only improves revenue collection but also reduces tax evasion by providing an accurate audit trail.

### Key Features of EFRIS
